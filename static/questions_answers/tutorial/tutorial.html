  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity doc-into">
    <strong>Datanavy search</strong> is a custom, <strong>local keywords-based</strong> search engine for searching files, raw text, and webpages. Local means it searches files that are loaded at user side as opposed to those available at the server
    or <strong>world wide web</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="w3-light-green w3-border-green w3-border-bottom">Keywords:</h2>
  <ul class="w3-ul w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">
    <li><strong>Query</strong> – sentence as like a question that requests for something.</li>
    <li><strong>Search keywords</strong> – Important words within a query which the search engine uses for searching.</li>
    <li><strong>Local</strong> – Resources in which you are the only on with access to them.</li>
    <li><strong>Resources</strong> – Anything that supplies text data to be searched during a search</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance</strong> – A number between 1- 100(%) representing similarity between search result and query by analyzing search keywords.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="w3-light-green w3-border-green w3-border-bottom">BASIC WORKFLOW</h2>
  <ul class="w3-ul  w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">
    <li>Step 1: Load resources to be searched(files, raw text, URLs).</li>
    <li>Step 2: Submit resources and ensure that they are ready for a search.</li>
    <li>Step 3: Enter search query into search field</li>
    <li>Step 4: View search results</li>
  </ul>





  <h2 class="w3-light-green w3-border-green w3-border-bottom">WORKFLOW DETAILED</h2>
  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-orange">USER INTERPHASE</h3>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">
    <strong>Datanavy search on start(Chrome desktop)</strong><br>
    <strong>Datanavy search popup dialog removed(Chrome desktop)</strong><br>
    At start of the application, you are presented with a dialog that summarizes the functionality of the application. The deep orange part of the application is navigation bar with 3 items(Resources, Search, Tutorials). Navigation bar helps navigate
    different part of application by clicking any of its items. Clicking resources item would navigate the screen to portion of application responsible for loading, uploading, and submitting of resources.
  </p>
  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-orange">RESOURCES</h3>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">
    Resource section with Resources item clicked
    Resources section is visible when starting the application. The section also contains its navigation bar which items specific to resources as opposed to application-level navigation bar. The navigation bar currently offers files, texts, and
    webpages items. Clicking any of those may change what’s displayed on resources section to match selected item. By default, the resources section displays contents related to files.
    <br><strong>Webpage item of resources section selected(Chrome desktop)</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>Hyperlink copied and pasted from built-in Google(Chrome desktop)</strong><br>

  <h2 class="w3-light-green w3-border-green w3-border-bottom">FEATURES</h2>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">The search is still under development with some features added and while others removed. Developers have been working very harder to ensure that any feature that pops in their minds is
    supported by the search engine and the web application. The
    application supports files as source of data for a search, currently PDF, DOCX, PPTX and TEXT files(not limited to *.TXT). Webpages are also supported through hyperlinks for retrieving search data from the internet. Raw text is supported in case
    the source of text is not a file or webpage.
  </p>

  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">At search side, it allows to analyze search query using search query analysis. Search query analysis extract linguistic features of sentence(query) such as synonyms, parts of speech(precise),
    categories identification, keywords detection, stop word
    detection, entity recognition and much more. Search query analysis was intended for allowing application users to optimize search queries to improve search relevance.</p>

  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">One powerful feature is highlighting, both the keywords and the text within search result are highlighted using different colors. This gives an opportunity to know which keywords were matched
    and how they relate to each other within the matched
    sentence/paragraph. Another powerful feature is ability to view the result within its original resource. It makes it easier to locate which part of resource text the result came from. Relevance for each search result is displayed on top of the
    results.
  </p>

  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">Search results can be customized such as setting minimum relevance and other settings affecting display of search results. It all depends on how strict you expect the search to be, setting
    high minimum relevance means that more result would be
    filtered and setting minimum relevance of 1% would include more results
  </p>



  <h2 class="w3-light-green w3-border-green w3-border-bottom">COMPARING TO WEB SEARCH ENGINES</h2>
  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">
    The search engine does not in anyway compete with advanced search engines(Google, Bing, etc.). But it offers an opportunity to have control of what to be searched. The application contains built-in Google to help offer features of advanced search
    engines. Google was designed to use advanced technologies for searching the whole web in short time with much higher relevance. Datanavy was designed for using keywords to try to locate which parts of loaded text query matched.
  </p>

  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">Web search engines search millions of documents and support wide variety of sources including images, videos, audios and much more. For something very powerful, web search engines as Google
    are necessary for those tasks. They can search billions of
    webpages in less than a second using powerful servers and algorithms. They are also based on context not on keywords giving them an opportunity find the best match to query. Datanavy search is using custom search algorithm which is currently
    keywords based but it’s still under development.</p>

  <p class="w3-margin w3-panel w3-light-green w3-opacity">Because the is very rich with data, that is why webpages are supported as resource/source. You will use your own search engine and then Copy (Ctrl + C) and Paste (Ctrl +V) hyperlink into the
    application. That way you will be combining the power of
    web search engines with Datanavy search.
